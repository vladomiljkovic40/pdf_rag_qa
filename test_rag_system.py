Introduction
This is a sample document created for testing the PDF RAG QA system. 
It contains multiple sections with different types of information to 
demonstrate the semantic search and question-answering capabilities.

Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Minimum 8 GB RAM (16 GB recommended)  
- Intel i3 processor or equivalent
- 500 MB free disk space for models
- Internet connection for initial model download

System Architecture
The RAG system consists of five main components:
1. PDF text extraction using PyMuPDF
2. Text segmentation with overlap preservation  
3. Semantic embedding using sentence transformers
4. Vector indexing with FAISS for fast search
5. Context-based answer generation

Features and Capabilities
The system can handle various question types including:
- What questions: Extracting definitions and explanations
- How questions: Finding procedural information  
- When questions: Identifying temporal information
- Where questions: Locating spatial references
- Why questions: Understanding causal relationships

Performance Metrics
Expected performance characteristics:
- Processing speed: 100 to 200 pages per minute
- Memory usage: 2 to 4 GB for typical documents
- Accuracy: 85 to 95 percent for well-formatted PDFs
- Response time: 1 to 3 seconds per question

Troubleshooting Guide
Common issues and solutions:
- PDF not loading: Check file format and permissions
- Memory errors: Reduce chunk size or use smaller model
- Poor accuracy: Verify PDF text quality and question clarity
- Slow performance: Consider GPU acceleration or smaller embeddings

Conclusion
This sample document demonstrates the types of content that work well
with the PDF RAG QA system. The system excels at finding relevant 
information and generating accurate answers based on document context.
